> *Per Aspera Ad Astra.*

My more comprehensive Github profile can be [found here](https://github.com/bgriffen). 

Although a lot of recent code is tied to new private ventures, some of my larger available work can be found at the following repositories. 

I'm taking a more "make public and clean up later" approach otherwise these would never be released. Please forgive any transgressions in the code below.
