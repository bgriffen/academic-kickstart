  abstract = {SARS-CoV2 infection leads to cardiac injury and dysfunction in 20-30\% of hospitalized patients1 and higher rates of mortality in patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease2,3. Inflammatory factors released as part of the {\textquoteleft}cytokine storm{\textquoteright} are thought to play a critical role in cardiac dysfunction in severe COVID-19 patients4. Here we use human cardiac organoids combined with high sensitivity phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing to identify inflammatory targets inducing cardiac dysfunction. This state-of-the-art pipeline allowed rapid deconvolution of mechanisms and identification of putative therapeutics. We identify a novel interferon-Î³ driven BRD4 (bromodomain protein 4)-fibrosis/iNOS axis as a key intracellular mediator of inflammation-induced cardiac dysfunction. This axis is therapeutically targetable using BRD4 inhibitors, which promoted full recovery of function in human cardiac organoids and prevented severe inflammation and death in a cytokine-storm mouse model. The BRD inhibitor INCB054329 was the most efficacious, and is a prime candidate for drug repurposing to attenuate cardiac dysfunction and improve COVID-19 mortality in humans.Competing Interest StatementR.J.M., J.E.H., G.A.Q.-R., D.M.T. and E.R.P. are listed as co-inventors on pending patents held by The University of Queensland and QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute that relate to cardiac organoid maturation and putative cardiac regeneration therapeutics.
