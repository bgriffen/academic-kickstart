Summary: What this site will be about
---

Hi. I'm Brendan.

I spent eight years studying computational astrophysics and cosmology then started two venture backed biotech companies across two countries. 

I wanted a place to share some of my learnings through these experiences and to create a resource for those that are thinking about a similar journey. 

I'll occasionally be posting my thoughts on deep tech startups, biotech, astrophysics, data and other musings over the coming months. 

I hope these resources are helpful, even if only to my younger self.
