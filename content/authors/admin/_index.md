Hi. Iâ€™m Brendan, a computational astrophysicist by training with core interests in biology, engineering and computer science based between San Francisco, California and Brisbane, Australia. I'm passionate about data driven decision making and using technology to better understand where we come from, how we live, and where we are going.

I'm currently CTO and co-founder of a (soon to be announced) startup focused on reversing heart failure, deploying complex *in silico* and *in vitro* systems at the intersection of computer science, robotics, tissue engineering, immunology and stem cell biology. 

I am the Project Lead on the [Caterpillar Project](https://www.caterpillarproject.org/), a large computational galaxy formation suite at MIT focusing on the origin and evolution of the Milky Way. I am also a project collaborator on the more general galaxy formation project of [Illustris](http://www.illustris-project.org/) at Harvard. 

You can find a few of my musings in these areas below on my (semi-)active blog. 

*"Sail Forth- Steer for the deep waters only. Reckless O soul, exploring. I with thee and thou with me. For we are bound where mariner has not yet dared go. And we will risk the ship, ourselves, and all." - Leaves of Grass, Whitman.*
